<!-- Hello! These is an HTML comment, and it will be hidden ("invisible") when you submit your issue. -->
<!-- In these comments, there are some extra details and hints about what we usually put in each space in this issue template. -->
<!-- Feel free to delete these comments if you want. It's also fine to leave them in. -->

## What isn't working right

<!-- For example: what button, link, or feature of the site isn't working? And what page does this happen on? -->
<!-- If the issue only happens after clicking/typing a specific thing, or only in Windows, or only in Chrome, that's all great to know. -->

<!-- Example: -->
<!-- The "click me" button doesn't do anything in Chrome -->

## What usually happens (when things are working right)

<!-- What's the usual behavior of Refuge Restrooms, when this issue isn't going on? -->
<!-- We'd like to know how you expect things should look when this is fixed, or how things looked before the problem began. -->
<!-- Sometimes this is clear already from the "What isn't working right" section. This section can be deleted if it doesn't add anything helpful. -->

<!-- Example: -->
<!-- When you click the "click me" button, a message pops up that says "Tada!" -->

## Steps to recreate the problem

<!-- How would someone make this issue happen again? -->
<!--This information helps us to see the problem ourselves and dig deeper into how it's happening. -->
<!-- Detailed, step-by-step instructions to make the issue happen are *greatly* appreciated! -->

<!-- example: -->
<!-- 1) Visit https://refugerestrooms.org with the Chrome web browser -->
<!-- 2) Click the "click me" button -->
<!-- 3) Nothing happens -->

## Screenshots

<!-- Sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words. -->
<!-- If you have a screenshot (or a few) showing the problem, here's a great spot to put them. Thanks! -->
