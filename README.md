# REFUGE restrooms

Providing safe restroom access for transgender, intersex, and gender noncomforming individuals.

REFUGE is an effort to fill the hole left by the now-defunct Safe2Pee website. It provides a resource for trans* and queer individuals in need of gender neutral and other safe bathrooms.

This project is open source. Feel free to contribute. We could use the help.


## Set Up For Contributing

Fork the repository. Make sure you have Ruby 2.0 and Rails 4.0. Make sure you have postgres, and that the client is running. I reccomend installing with homebrew. Once you have postgres up and running, run <code>rake db:migrate </code> and <code> rake db:seed </code>. This will give you the original safe2pee data that you can use for development.
