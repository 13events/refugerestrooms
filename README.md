**REFUGE restrooms**

Providing safe restroom access for transgender, intersex, and gender noncomforming individuals. 

REFUGE is an effort to fill the hole by the now defunct Safe2Pee website. It provides a resource for trans and queer individuals in need of gender neutral and other safe bathrooms. 

This project is open source. Feel free to contribute. We could use the help.
