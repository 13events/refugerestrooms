**REFUGE**

Providing safe restroom access for transgender, intersex, and gender noncomforming individuals. 

REFUGE is an effort to fill the hole by the now defunct. Safe2Pee website and provide a resource for trans and queer individuals in need of gender neutral and other safe bathrooms. 

Right now this is a work in progress for me. I'm learning rails, and learning each step as I do it. My goal is to get this operational though as soon as possible. However, I am working full time (not in the software industry - although my hope is to become good enough to get a job in the industry). My immediate goal is to get something that is functional and working. I can work and adding features and making it all fancy once I have something that is functional. RIght now there is nothing that allows people to access the old Safe2Pee data in a useable format. So once I seed this database with that information -- it will at least allow individuals to access that information in a useable format. 

This project is open source. Feel free to contribute. We could use the help.
